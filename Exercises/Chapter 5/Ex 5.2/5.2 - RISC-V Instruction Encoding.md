## [5.2 - RISC-V Instruction Encoding](https://riscv-programming.org/ale-exercise-book/book/ch05-02-riscv-instruction-encoding.html#risc-v-instruction-encoding)

I am not going to do this exercises and this doen'st help me learn risc-v at all again like all the exercies to this point but is more aboutr parsing and then mapping those parings to codes that then uses some of the techniques fromt he last exercise. This will use a bucnh of c code and will be quite involved as an exercise without actaulyl teaching you anything aboutr risc-v and how to rpgoram in it.

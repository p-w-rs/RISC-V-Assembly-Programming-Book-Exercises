## [4.1 - Organization of an ELF file](https://riscv-programming.org/ale-exercise-book/book/ch04-01-organization-elf-file.html#organization-of-an-elf-file)

I am really not interested in doing this, I really want to learn assembly. I understand compilation and understanding how it works can be a part of this but really the book does not really prepare you or motivate you to be able to do this kind of thing, nor do I think it is the right place to start. I think this type of depth should be intoduced later and be motivated with a reason to do it.

Also Ex 3.2 doesn't exist so you cannot actaully look at the ELF file they want you to.

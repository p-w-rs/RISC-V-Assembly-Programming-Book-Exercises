# RISC-V Assembly Programming Book Exercises

This repository contains the answers to the exercises for the [*RISC-V ALE Exercise Book*](https://riscv-programming.org/ale-exercise-book/book/title-page.html) which is an accompianment to [*An Introduction to Assembly Programming with RISC-V*](https://riscv-programming.org/book/riscv-book.html#pf34). All of the exercises were done on a Mac by using the riscv-tools available via [homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew tap riscv-software-src/riscv
brew install riscv-tools
```

And all of the resulting executable were run with the [RISC-V ALE Simulator](https://riscv-programming.org/ale/). The directory structure is as follows, Exercises -> Chapters -> Sections, where each section nmumber contains the files needed for that sections and a readme.md file which is the asnwer document for the exercises in that section.

## Review

The review will be forthcoming when I finish all of the exercises.
